# Development Checkpoints & Technical Documentation

This directory contains checkpoint documentation and technical references created during the development process to track fixes, investigations, and implementation details.

## Contents

### Fix Documentation
- `MISTRAL_PIXTRAL_FIX.md` - Detailed documentation of the Mistral parameter validation fix
- `README_S3_EVENTS.md` - S3 event processing documentation for classification Lambda

## Purpose

These files serve as:
- **Development Checkpoints** - Track major fixes and their implementation details
- **Technical References** - Detailed explanations for complex issues and solutions
- **Debug Documentation** - Help for troubleshooting similar issues in the future
- **Implementation History** - Record of what was tried, what worked, and what didn't

## Usage

Reference these documents when:
- Debugging similar parameter validation issues
- Understanding the S3 event processing flow
- Investigating model switching behavior
- Reviewing implementation decisions and their rationale

## Separation from Project Documentation

These checkpoint files are kept separate from the main project documentation in `documentation/` to distinguish between:
- **Project Documentation**: End-user guides, architecture, and operational docs
- **Development Checkpoints**: Technical implementation details and debugging information
