Extract company data from the provided JSON document following these detailed guidelines. I'll need you to:

Show me your reasoning in numbered steps (how you decided what to extract, how you handled missing fields, etc.).
Then output the final JSON with all extracted information.

# Extraction Requirements
1. Document Processing:
   - Input is a JSON with document_number, document_type, category, text, and path
   - Documents may be in Spanish, Portuguese, or English
   - Preserve original language terms in company names, addresses, and relationship types
   - IMPORTANT: Always determine page count by analyzing document structure
   - Look for page markers, section breaks, or other indicators in the document text to identify separate pages

2. Document Validation (Tip 0):
   - Check ONLY for information in the tables, ignore sections that are informational only
   - If the document doesn't have information or doesn't correspond to an official form:
     * Only fill the companyName you identify
     * Add to relatedParties a message: "Necesita revisión manual, documento no corresponde a formulario oficial"
   - Process ONLY tabular data in vertical layout pages
   - Ignore all non-tabular content except document headers

3. Data Normalization:
   - Convert all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format
   - For the address, check for the value of Distrito and Municipio and add to the mainAddress
   - Handle anonymized data by preserving asterisks in identificationNumber
   - For country determination:
     * First look for explicit mentions of country in the document
     * If not found, use the documentType to infer country using the COMPANY_ID hash table
     * Example: If documentType is "NIT", infer country as "Colombia"

4. Related Party Handling:
   - Extract each related party occurrence separately with complete information
   - Each related party appears in a separate row in the document's tables
   - On every page in the table, you can see a number like 1, 2, 3 and so on on the left side to identify a row
   - Use these row numbers to correctly fill the related parties information
   - For each person, extract:
     * firstName (first name components)
     * lastName (remaining name components)
     * identificationType (e.g., "1", "4" or name like "CC", "dni")
     * identificationNumber (as it appears, or "********" if anonymized)
     * noveltyType (exact term from document, e.g., "Registro", "Actualización")
     * participationPercentage (percentage value without the % symbol)
   - When a person appears multiple times with different roles, create separate entries for each occurrence
   - Always evaluate if the person has more than one name and extract accordingly

5. Country Determination:
   - Use this hash table if you can't find the city or country in the document:
   ```text
   COMPANY_ID = {
     "Argentina":"CUIT","Bolivia":"NIT","Brasil":"CPF","Brasil":"CNPJ","Chile":"RUT",
     "Colombia":"NIT","Costa Rica":"CIF","Cuba":"NIF","Ecuador":"RUC","El Salvador":"NIT",
     "España":"NIF","Guatemala":"NIT","Honduras":"RTN","México":"RFC","Nicaragua":"RUC",
     "Panamá":"RUC","Paraguay":"RUC","Perú":"RUC","República Dominicana":"RNC",
     "Uruguay":"RUT","Venezuela":"RIF"
   }
   PERSON_ID = {
     "Brasil":"CI","Bolivia":"CI","Chile":"CI","Costa Rica":"CI","Ecuador":"CI",
     "Nicaragua":"CI","Uruguay":"CI","Venezuela":"CI","Argentina":"DNI",
     "España":"DNI","Honduras":"DNI","Perú":"DNI","Colombia":["CC","TI","CE"],
     "Cuba":"CI","México":["CURP","CRIP"],"Guatemala":"DPI",
     "El Salvador":"DUI","República Dominicana":"CIE",
     "Paraguay":"CIC/CI","Panamá":"CIP","Portugal":"CC","Puerto Rico":"ID"
   }
   ```

6. Validation:
   - Compare your extraction against RUB schema.json requirements
   - Ensure all required fields are present: companyName, documentType, taxId, relatedParties
   - For relatedParties, ensure each entry has firstName, lastName, identificationType, identificationNumber, noveltyType, and participationPercentage
   - If the document is not an official form, include only companyName and a message in relatedParties

7. Confidence Assessment:
   - Evaluate certainty for each extracted value
   - Note low-confidence extractions in your reasoning
   - Include scores in final output as a separate "confidenceScores" object
   - Assign scores based on:
     * 90-100: Exact text match found
     * 70-89: Logical inference from context
     * Below 70: Requires human review
   - For relatedParties, provide an overall confidence score for the extraction of all parties

# Required Output
```json
{
  "path": "$pdf_path",
  "result": {
    "companyName": "",
    "country": "",
    "documentType": "",
    "taxId": "",
    "relatedParties": [
      {
        "firstName": "",
        "lastName": "",
        "identificationType": "",
        "identificationNumber": "",
        "noveltyType": "",
        "participationPercentage": ""
      }
    ]
  },
  "confidenceScores": {
    "companyName": 95,
    "documentType": 90,
    "country": 100,
    "taxId": 100,
    "relatedParties": 85
  },
  "document_type": "$document_type",
  "document_number": "$document_number",
  "category": "$category"
}
```

Remember to provide detailed reasoning about how you extracted each field, especially for any fields where you had to make inferences or handle ambiguous data.

Only return the data collected in the required JSON format.
