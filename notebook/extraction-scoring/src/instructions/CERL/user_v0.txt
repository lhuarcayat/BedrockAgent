Extract company data from the provided JSON document following these strict guidelines:

# Extraction Requirements
1. Document Processing:
   - Input is a JSON with document_number, document_type, category, text, and path
   - Documents may be in Spanish, Portuguese, or English
   - Preserve original language terms in company names, addresses, and relationship types

2. Data Normalization:
   - Convert all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format
   - Format addresses as "[Primary Address] - [Type] de [Name]" (e.g., "Calle Siempre Viva 123 - Municipio de San Isidro")
   - Handle anonymized data by extracting firstName, lastName, and identificationNumber with asterisks
   - Extract company size from "Tama√±o de la empresa" section

3. Related Party Handling:
   - List each occurrence separately with complete information
   - Preserve exact relationshipType terminology from document
   - Include all occurrences when a person appears multiple times
   - For anonymized entries (e.g., "ACEPTACION SIN**********"), split name components and preserve asterisks in identificationNumber

4. Validation:
   - Verify against CERL schema.json
   - Ensure all required fields are present
   - Confirm dates are properly formatted
   - Check taxId follows the pattern ^[0-9.\-]+$$

    "lastRegistrationRenewalDate": ""
  },
  "document_type": "$document_type",

  "category": "$category"
}
```

Think step-by-step to ensure accurate extraction and proper JSON formatting:
1. Analyze the document structure to identify key sections
2. Extract company information systematically
3. Process related parties one by one
4. Validate the draft JSON against schema requirements
5. Make necessary corrections before finalizing

Only return the data collected in the required JSON format.
