Extract company data from the provided JSON document following these strict guidelines:

Show me your reasoning in numbered steps (how you decided what to extract, how you handled missing fields, etc.).
Then output the final JSON.

# Extraction Requirements
1. Document Processing:
   - Input is a JSON with document_number, document_type, category, text, and path
   - Documents may be in Spanish, Portuguese, or English
   - Preserve original language terms in company names, addresses, and relationship types
   - Count the total number of pages in the document (do not extract this from document text)

2. Data Normalization:
   - Convert all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format including companyDuration when a specific date is provided
   - Format addresses as "[Primary Address] - [Type] de [Name]" (e.g., "Calle Siempre Viva 123 - Municipio de San Isidro")
   - Handle anonymized data by extracting firstName, lastName, and identificationNumber with asterisks
   - Extract company size from "Tamaño de la empresa" section
   - Look for companyDuration in sections titled: "Vigencia", "Término de Duración", "Certifica - Vigencia", "Duración de la Sociedad", or "Plazo de Constitución"
   - If the day extracted is larger than 80 years from today, check again the date by extracting from the document instead of the metadata

3. Related Party Handling:
   - List each occurrence separately with complete information
   - Preserve exact relationshipType terminology from document
   - Include all occurrences when a person appears multiple times
   - For anonymized entries (e.g., "ACEPTACION SIN**********"), split name components and preserve asterisks in identificationNumber

4. Validation:
   - Verify against CERL schema.json
   - Ensure all required fields are present
   - Confirm all dates including companyDuration are properly formatted as YYYY-MM-DD
   - Check taxId follows the pattern ^[0-9.\-]+$$

  },

}

Think step-by-step to ensure accurate extraction and proper JSON formatting:
1. Count the total number of pages in the document
2. Analyze the document structure to identify key sections
3. Extract company information systematically
4. Process related parties one by one
5. Validate the draft JSON against schema requirements
6. Make necessary corrections before finalizing

Only return the data collected in the required JSON format.
