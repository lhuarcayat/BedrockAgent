Please process the following PDF and extract the company data according to the ACC schema:
**Do not** include any examples, commentary, or markdown. Only return the raw JSON below.


1. Extract the json
- PDF to process: `$pdf_path`
- Classification metadata:
  - document_number: `$document_number`
  - document_type: `$document_type`
  - category: `$category`


2. Validate your draft JSON against:
   - The JSON schema in `schema.json`.
   - The PERSON_ID / COMPANY_ID lookup rules for documentCountry.
   If you spot any missing/extra fields or mis-classified parties, **fix** them now.

3. **Return exactly this JSON structure** (with your substituted values and the fields defined in schema.json):

```json
{
  "path": "$pdf_path",
  "result": {
    /* companyName, documentType, taxId, relatedParties */
  },
  "document_type": "$document_type",
  "document_number": "$document_number",
  "category": "$category",
  "country": "$country"
}

Think step-by-step and don't include any examples, commentary, or markdown in the responses
