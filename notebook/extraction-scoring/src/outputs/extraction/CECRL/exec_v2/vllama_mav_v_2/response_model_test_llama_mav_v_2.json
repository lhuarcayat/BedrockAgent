          "text": "To address the task effectively, let's break down the steps involved in extracting personal identification data from the provided document.\n\n1. **Understanding the Input**: The input is a JSON object containing information about a document, including its path, type, and category. However, the actual document content is not provided directly in the input JSON.\n\n2. **Document Processing**: Since the document content is empty, we cannot directly extract any information. Normally, we would process the document text, looking for personal names, identification numbers, and document types.\n\n3. **Document Validation**: Without the document content, we cannot validate whether it's an official identification document. We would typically look for official seals, headers, or specific keywords indicating it's a government-issued ID.\n\n4. **Data Extraction and Normalization**: Extraction involves identifying and separating names into firstName and lastName, determining the document type, and extracting the identification number. We would translate foreign document types into Spanish equivalents.\n\n5. **Critical Distinctions**: We need to differentiate between the country that issued the document (country_issuer) and the person's nationality. This requires understanding the document's content and possibly the context.\n\n6. **Image Document and OCR Considerations**: Since the document content is not available, we cannot assess its quality or apply OCR techniques. Normally, we would attempt to extract information even from image-based documents by looking for text fragments, government seals, or using layout heuristics.\n\n7. **Confidence Assessment**: We would evaluate the certainty of each extracted value and include confidence scores in the output.\n\nGiven the constraints (empty document content), let's proceed with the information we have:\n\n- The document path is given as \"../../shared/file_examples/CECRL/5120000874/L75GVP89V_2024-09-12.pdf\".\n- The document type is \"person\", and the document number is \"5120000874\".\n- The category is \"CECRL\".\n\nSince we cannot extract any meaningful information from the document due to the lack of content, we will have to indicate that the document needs manual review.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. The document content is empty, so we cannot extract personal identification data.\n2. We cannot validate if the document is an official identification document.\n3. Without content, we cannot determine names, document type, or identification number.\n4. We will indicate that the document needs manual review due to the lack of information.\n\nGiven the schema and the requirements, the output should be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"../../shared/file_examples/CECRL/5120000874/L75GVP89V_2024-09-12.pdf\",\n  \"result\": {\n    \"firstName\": \"\",\n    \"lastName\": \"\",\n    \"country_issuer\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"identificationType\": \"\",\n    \"identificationNumber\": \"\",\n    \"message\": \"Necesita revisi√≥n manual, documento ilegible\"\n  },\n  \"confidenceScores\": {\n    \"firstName\": 0,\n    \"lastName\": 0,\n    \"country_issuer\": 0,\n    \"nationality\": 0,\n    \"identificationType\": 0,\n    \"identificationNumber\": 0\n  },\n  \"document_type\": \"person\",\n  \"document_number\": \"5120000874\",\n  \"category\": \"CECRL\"\n}\n```\n\nThis output reflects the inability to extract meaningful information due to the empty document content and flags the document for manual review."
