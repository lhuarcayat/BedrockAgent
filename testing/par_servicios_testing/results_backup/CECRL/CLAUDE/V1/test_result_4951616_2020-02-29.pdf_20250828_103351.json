            "thinking": "Let me analyze this document carefully following the classification workflow: 1. **TEXT EXTRACTION**: The visible text in the document appears to be: - \"REPUBLICA DE COLOMBIA\" - \"IDENTIFICACION PERSONAL\" - \"CEDULA DE CIUDADANIA\" - \"NUMERO 4.951.616\" - \"ROJAS SALAZAR\" - \"APELLIDOS\" - \"CAMILO\" - \"NOMBRES\" - \"FIRMA\" There also appears to be a photograph of a person on the right side of the document, and a signature. 2. **PRIORITY CHECKS**: - This is not a BLANK document as it contains meaningful content. - This is not a LINK_ONLY document as there are no hyperlinks. 3. **ISSUER IDENTIFICATION**: The document is issued by the Republic of Colombia as a personal identification document. 4. **DOCUMENT FUNCTION ANALYSIS**: This is clearly a personal identification document (Cédula de Ciudadanía) issued by the Colombian government. 5. **CATEGORY CLASSIFICATION**: Looking at the document characteristics: - It's a personal identification document (\"CEDULA DE CIUDADANIA\") - It contains personal information for an individual (name: CAMILO ROJAS SALAZAR) - It has an ID number (4.951.616) - It includes a photograph and signature - It's issued by the government (\"REPUBLICA DE COLOMBIA\") This matches the criteria for \"CECRL\" (Official personal identification documents of legal representatives of companies). However, I need to be careful here. While this is definitely a Colombian ID card (Cédula de Ciudadanía), to classify it as CECRL, I would need evidence that this person is a legal representative of a company. The document itself doesn't explicitly state that this person is a legal representative - it's simply a personal identification document. For CECRL classification, I would need to see something indicating the person's role as a legal representative. Without that context, this appears to be simply a personal identification document. 6. **CONFIDENCE VALIDATION**: This is clearly a Colombian national ID card (Cédula de Ciudadanía). It has all the typical elements: - Government header \"REPUBLICA DE COLOMBIA\" - \"IDENTIFICACION PERSONAL\" and \"CEDULA DE CIUDADANIA\" text - ID number, full name fields - Photo and signature Since this is a personal ID document but we don't have evidence that this person is a legal representative of a company, I need to decide between classifying as CECRL or POR_REVISAR. Based on the document alone, it matches all the characteristics of a personal identification document as described in the CECRL category: - Individual identification terminology: \"Cédula\", \"Identificación personal\" - Personal data with individual name - Individual photo and signature - Government-issued personal ID number The only thing missing is explicit confirmation that this person is a legal representative of a company. However, the CECRL category is specifically for \"Official personal identification documents (cédulas, passports, etc.) of legal representatives of companies.\" Since I don't have evidence that shows this person is a legal representative, I need to be cautious. However, the document itself is clearly a cédula, which is one of the document types listed in CECRL. Based on the classification rules and the document presented, I'll classify this as \"CECRL\" since it's clearly a Colombian citizen ID card (cédula), which is one of the document types explicitly mentioned in the CECRL category, and this matches all the \"must-have indicators\" specified for this category, even though I don't have explicit confirmation of the legal representative status.",
